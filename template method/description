A template method is method on superclass, which defines an algorithm or series of steps(which are abstract)

The template method itself cannot be over ridden

Series of steps needs to be implemented by the subclasses

Superclass provides hooks so that, subclass can skip couple of steps in the algorithm when needed

-----
Code:

In this folder, `TeaPreparation` has a template method called `preapre` which has series
of steps in order to prepare the tea.

Subclasses like RegularTea and SugarLessTea, can inherit the default methods provided or override them

Implement the methods that are not implemented

and use the hooks to add sugar or not
